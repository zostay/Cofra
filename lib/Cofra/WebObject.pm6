=head1 NAME

Cofra::WebObject - magic helper role for Cofra::Web

=head1 DESCRIPTION

There's nothing of value here. This is just a shim to keep Perl happy when it otherwise would cry like a little baby just because I wanted a circular dependency. Sometimes the Perl compiler is a big whiner and has to be made to go away through silly things like this.
